Description: 
    Describes how to use the csaw package to detect differentially bound regions in ChIP-seq data. 
    This provides instructions on how to read in BAM files to obtain a per-window count matrix, 
    filtering to obtain high-abundance windows of interest, 
    normalization of sample-specific biases, testing for differential binding, 
    consolidation of per-window results to obtain per-region statistics,
    and annotation and visualization of the DB results.
